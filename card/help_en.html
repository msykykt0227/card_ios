● Table cards: Stacked in the center of the screen. The top card is face up. <br>
● Deck: A pile of face-down cards in the upper left. Click to turn over a card. <br>
● Hand: The frontmost card among the face-up cards displayed when the "deck" is turned over. <br>
● Foundation cards: Cards moved to the upper right or bottom of the screen (if there are four or more card types). The cards in this foundation pile are arranged in ascending order from A by suit. (Blank at the start of the game)<br>
